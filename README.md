## Prerequisites

The challenges in this workshop assume that you have some existing experience of using Microsoft Azure. Experience of the following is not required, but will be highly beneficial:

Training machine learning models using Python frameworks such as scikit-learn.
Managing data, compute and model training experiments with Azure Machine Learning.

## Setup
1. Create a **Machine Learning** resource in your Azure subscription. This will create an Azure Machine Learning *workspace* and some related resources.
    * After creating your workspace in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), use the web-based [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com) interface to work with it.
1. In your workspace, create a **Compute Instance** and wait for it to start.


## Running the sample

Please follow the instructions for the challenges posted in this repository.
